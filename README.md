## S. Elliott Johnson

Hi there! I'm a software developer specializing in TypeScript, Svelte, C#, and Go. I work in both Azure and AWS to create fast, scalable applications for as little money as possible. I started off as an analyst in the Business Intelligence world and quickly fell into the utter anarchy that is software development. I wouldn't have it any other way!

### Stuff I do

- Member of [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs) specializing in SvelteKit (1.0 here we come, baby!)
- Big time cyclist, both on and off the road

Come back later when my busy life allows me to turn this whole bio thing into something more interesting. Or contact me at sejohnson@torchcloudconsulting.com if you want to get in touch!
